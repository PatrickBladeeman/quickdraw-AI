# Assets Licensing Policy

This repository is public and research-oriented. To respect third-party licenses:

- **Do NOT commit paid or proprietary art/animation/audio** (e.g., Synty, Kubold, premium packs).
- Use placeholders or free assets with permissive licenses (Kenney, your own art), or provide install steps.
- If you include third-party assets, add their licenses into this directory and credit the authors.

This policy helps keep the repo redistributable for academic use.
